Recap of the Situation:

You are tasked with figuring out how to increase your sales team’s performance. In our hypothetical situation, potential customers have rather spontaneous demand. When this happens, your sales team puts an order lead in the system. Your sales reps then try to get set up a meeting that occurs around the time the order lead was noticed. Sometimes before, sometimes after. Your sales reps have an expense budget and always combine the meeting with a meal for which they pay. The sales reps expense their costs and hand the invoices to the accounting team for processing. After the potential customer has decided whether or not they want to go with your offer, your diligent sales reps track whether or not the order lead converted into a sale.

For your analysis, you have access to the following three data sources:

    order_leads (contains all the order leads and conversion info)
    sales_team (includes companies and responsible sales reps)
    invoices (provides information on the invoices and participants)
